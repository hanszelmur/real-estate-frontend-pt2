## 🔧 Core System Rules & Logic

### Enhanced Booking & Sales Completion Flow

This system implements an enhanced booking flow with exclusive/shared property viewings, agent-controlled appointment completion, and property state transitions.

#### Appointment Status Flow

```
┌─────────────┐     Agent      ┌──────────┐
│   PENDING   │ ─── Accept ──▶ │ ACCEPTED │
└─────────────┘                └──────────┘
       │                            │
       │ Agent                      │ Agent Action
       │ Reject                     ▼
       │                    ┌───────────────┐
       ▼                    │  DONE or SOLD │
┌──────────────────┐        └───────────────┘
│ PENDING_APPROVAL │               │
│ (new agent auto- │               │
│  assigned)       │               │
└──────────────────┘               │
       │                           ▼
       │ Customer             ┌─────────┐
       │ Approve              │ Property│
       ▼                      │ State   │
┌─────────────┐               │ Change  │
│   PENDING   │               └─────────┘
└─────────────┘
```

#### Status Behavior Summary Table

| Status | Description | Property Available? | Customer Action | Agent Action |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `pending` | Awaiting agent confirmation | Pending (first viewer) | Wait | Accept/Reject |
| `pending_approval` | New agent assigned, needs customer approval | Pending | Approve agent or Select different | Wait |
| `accepted` | Viewing confirmed | Pending | Attend viewing | Mark Done/Sold |
| `done` | Viewing finished, no purchase | ✅ Available | - | - |
| `sold` | Property purchased | ❌ Sold | - | - |
| `rejected` | Agent declined | Depends | Select new agent | - |
| `cancelled` | Booking cancelled | Depends | - | - |

#### Agent Appointment Completion Actions

When an agent has an accepted appointment, they control when and how the viewing ends:

1. **Mark as Done** (`done` status):
   - Viewing finished, customer did not purchase
   - Property immediately becomes available for new bookings
   - Queued customers are notified that property is available
   - Agent's buffer period (2 hours) applies

2. **Mark as Sold** (`sold` status):
   - Property purchased by customer
   - Property status changes to `sold`
   - Property hidden from customer search/booking
   - All other pending viewings for this property are cancelled
   - Affected customers receive cancellation notification
   - Agent's sales count incremented
   - Property added to Agent's "Sold Properties" tab

#### Property Visibility Rules

| User Role | Available | Pending | Sold |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------|
| Customer/Public | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ❌ Hidden |
| Agent | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible (Sold tab) |
| Admin | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible (Sold tab) |

#### Notification Flow for Status Changes

| Event | Recipient | Notification Type |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Viewing marked done | Customer | `viewing_done` |
| Property becomes available | Queued customers | `property_available` |
| Property sold | Buyer | `property_sold` (congratulations) |
| Property sold | Other customers with pending viewings | `property_sold` (cancelled) |

### Booking Flow
```
1. Customer selects property → Chooses agent (or auto-assign) → Selects START TIME only
2. Booking submitted as PENDING → Agent notified
3. Agent ACCEPTS or REJECTS → Customer notified
4. If rejected: System auto-assigns new available agent → Customer approves or selects different
5. Agent conducts viewing → Marks as DONE (available) or SOLD (purchased)
```

### Buffer/Slot/Availability Logic

```pseudocode
FUNCTION isAgentAvailable(agentId, date, startTime, endTime):
    // Check vacation status
    IF agent.isOnVacation THEN RETURN false
    
    // Check if slot exists and is not blocked
    slot = agent.availability.find(date, startTime, endTime)
    IF slot.isBooked AND NOT slot.bookingId THEN RETURN false  // Manually blocked
    
    // Check for appointment conflicts
    FOR EACH appointment IN appointments:
        IF appointment.agentId == agentId 
           AND appointment.date == date
           AND appointment.status NOT IN ['cancelled', 'rejected']
           AND timeOverlaps(startTime, endTime, appointment.startTime, appointment.endTime):
            RETURN false
    
    // Check 2-hour buffer after completed appointments
    completedAppts = getCompletedAppointments(agentId, date)
    FOR EACH completed IN completedAppts:
        bufferEnd = completed.endTime + 2 hours
        IF startTime < bufferEnd THEN RETURN false
    
    RETURN true

FUNCTION timeOverlaps(start1, end1, start2, end2):
    RETURN start1 < end2 AND end1 > start2
```

### Agent Assignment Priority
```pseudocode
FUNCTION findAvailableAgent(customerId, date, startTime, endTime, excludeIds):
    blacklisted = customer.blacklistedAgentIds
    
    availableAgents = agents.filter(agent =>
        NOT agent.isOnVacation
        AND agent.id NOT IN blacklisted
        AND agent.id NOT IN excludeIds
        AND isAgentAvailable(agent.id, date, startTime, endTime)
    )
    
    // Return first available (could be sorted by rating/availability)
    RETURN availableAgents[0] OR null
```

### Race Logic (Competing Property Interests)
```pseudocode
ON createAppointment(propertyId, customerId):
    existingViewers = appointments.filter(propertyId, status != 'cancelled')
    
    IF existingViewers.length == 0:
        // First viewer gets purchase rights
        appointment.hasPurchaseRights = true
        property.status = 'pending'
        property.firstViewerCustomerId = customerId
    ELSE:
        // Subsequent viewers - viewing only
        appointment.hasPurchaseRights = false
        notifyCustomer("Another customer has priority purchase rights")
```

---

## ⚠️ DO NOT BREAK - Business Rules

1. **Double-booking Prevention**: NEVER allow two appointments with same agent at overlapping times
2. **Buffer Period**: Agent unavailable for 2 hours after completing a viewing (done or sold status)
3. **Race Logic**: First viewer ALWAYS gets purchase rights
4. **SMS Verification**: BOTH parties must be verified for messaging to work
5. **Priority Warning**: NEVER show "another customer has priority" to the firstViewerCustomerId
6. **Blacklist Respect**: NEVER assign blacklisted agents to a customer
7. **Sold Property Visibility**: NEVER show sold properties in customer/public property listings
8. **Agent-Only Completion**: ONLY agents can mark appointments as done or sold
9. **Cascade Cancellation**: When property is marked sold, ALL other pending appointments for that property must be cancelled automatically
10. **Instant Availability**: When marked done, property MUST become immediately available for new bookings

---

## 🔌 How to Extend/Modify

### Adding New Appointment Status
1. Add status to `Appointment['status']` union type in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add color mapping in `getStatusBadgeColor()` functions
3. Update status filters in dashboard components
4. Add notification type if needed

### Adding New User Fields
1. Update `User` or `Agent` interface in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add to mock data in `src/data/mockData.ts`
3. Update profile settings page to handle new field
4. Add context function if field needs updating

### Modifying Buffer Period
```typescript
// In AgentCalendar.tsx - getBufferSlotsForDate()
// Change the '2' to desired hours
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {  // ← Modify this value
```

### Adding New Notification Types
1. Add type to `Notification['type']` in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Use `addNotification()` from AppContext where needed

### Adding Real SMS Verification
Replace the demo verification in settings pages:
```typescript
// Replace this demo code:
if (smsCode.length === 6) {
  updateUserSmsVerification(currentUser.id, true);
}

// With actual API call:
const response = await verifySmsCode(phone, smsCode);
if (response.success) {
  updateUserSmsVerification(currentUser.id, true);
}
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run lint     # Run linting
```

### Demo Login
- **Customer**: Browse properties and book viewings
- **Agent**: Manage bookings and availability
- **Admin**: Access via `/internal/admin/dashboard`

---

## 📅 Calendar Logic (Agent)

### Full-Month View
- Google Calendar-style monthly grid showing all days
- Each day cell shows appointment previews (up to 3) with status colors
- Click any day to switch to day view
- Navigation: Previous/Next month, Today button

### Day View
- Hourly time slots from 8 AM to 6 PM
- Shows appointments, blocked slots, and buffer periods
- Color coding: Yellow (Pending), Green (Accepted), Blue (Scheduled), Gray (Completed)
- Buffer periods shown in orange (2-hour rest after completed viewings)

### Buffer Enforcement
```
After a COMPLETED appointment ends:
  → Next 2 hours are automatically blocked
  → Buffer slots shown in orange on calendar
  → Agent cannot be booked during buffer period
```

---

## 📱 Profile Flows & Verification

### Settings Page (Customer & Agent)
1. **Profile Information**: Name, Email, Phone (editable)
2. **Phone Verification Section**:
   - Shows current verification status (green = verified, yellow = not verified)
   - Unverified users see "Send Verification Code" button
   - Demo: Any 6-digit code verifies the phone

> **Note**: This demo app uses role-based login without passwords. Password change functionality is not currently implemented. See [Planned Enhancements](#planned-enhancements) for future authentication features.

### What Blocks Users from Acting
| Blocker | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Not logged in | Cannot book, access dashboards |
| Not SMS verified | Cannot message (both parties need verification) |
| Agent on vacation | Hidden from agent selection |
| Blacklisted agent | Never assigned to that customer |

### Phone Verification Storage
- Stored in `User.smsVerified` and `Agent.smsVerified` fields
- Updated via `updateUserSmsVerification()` or `updateAgentSmsVerification()`
- Persisted in React context state (demo only - production needs backend)

---

## 📬 Automated Messaging & Notifications

### One-Way Notifications (System → User)
All notifications are **system-generated** and one-way. Users cannot reply to notifications.

### Notification Types
| Type | Recipient | Trigger |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `booking_new` | Agent | New booking assigned |
| `booking_accepted` | Customer | Agent accepts booking |
| `booking_rejected` | Customer | Agent rejects booking |
| `agent_reassigned` | Customer | New agent auto-assigned after rejection |
| `no_agents_available` | Customer | No agents available for slot |
| `viewing_only` | Customer | Another customer has priority |
| `viewing_done` | Customer | Agent marked viewing as completed |
| `property_available` | Queued customers | Property became available after viewing |
| `property_sold` | Buyer | Congratulations on purchase |
| `property_sold` | Other customers | Pending viewing cancelled due to sale |
| `viewing_queued` | Customer | Viewing queued due to prior bookings |

### Messaging (Two-Way Chat)
- **Requirements**: Both customer AND agent must be SMS verified
- **Scope**: Only available for ACCEPTED or SCHEDULED appointments
- **Location**: Chat drawer accessible from header
- **Templates**: Distinct from notifications - conversational messages only

### Centralized Notification Service
All notifications flow through `addNotification()` in AppContext:
```typescript
addNotification({
  userId: recipientId,
  type: 'notification_type',
  title: 'Title',
  message: 'Message content',
  read: false,
  relatedId: appointmentOrPropertyId,
});
```

---

## ⚠️ Developer & AI Warnings

### DRY Principle
- **DO NOT** duplicate business logic - all core logic lives in `AppContext.tsx`
- **DO NOT** create duplicate notification functions - use `addNotification()`
- **DO NOT** duplicate status color mappings - reference existing `getStatusBadgeColor()` functions

### Inheritance & Type Safety
- All user types extend base `User` interface
- `Agent` extends `User` with agent-specific fields
- Always use TypeScript interfaces from `src/types/index.ts`

### Mandatory README Updates
> **Every PR must include README updates if it changes:**
> - Any UI component or page
> - Any user flow or state
> - Any business logic
> - Screenshots must be current - remove/replace outdated images
