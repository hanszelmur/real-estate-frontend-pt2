A comprehensive real estate frontend application for TES Properties, based in Davao City, Philippines. This application showcases property listings, booking flows, and role-based dashboards for customers, agents, and administrators.

## 🎯 Latest System Enhancement Release

This release includes major enhancements to booking, property, and purchase flows:

- ✅ **Start-Time-Only Booking** - Customers select only a start time (no fixed end times). Agent controls when viewing ends.
- ✅ **Agent Unavailability Management** - Agents can mark any period as unavailable (e.g., lunch break, personal events) via calendar
- ✅ **Exclusive Property Viewings with Waitlist** - Properties can be set as exclusive (one customer per slot). If taken, customers join a visible waitlist with queue position display (e.g., "You are #2 in line")
- ✅ **Group Viewing Support** - Non-exclusive properties allow multiple customers to book the same time slot
- ✅ **Enhanced Customer Status Messaging** - Clear status display (confirmed, queued, promoted) throughout the booking interface
- ✅ **7-Day Rolling Booking Window** - Strict limit on booking to next 7 days only
- ✅ **Purchase Priority Queue** - Fair first-come, first-served purchase rights by booking timestamp
- ✅ **Cancel Appointment Feature** - Customers can cancel with confirmation, instant priority release
- ✅ **Priority Status Display** - Professional queue position display for customers and agents
- ✅ **Sold Properties Tracking** - Visible to agents and admins with sale price reference
- ✅ **Enhanced Queue Tables** - Agent dashboard shows booking queue by property
- ✅ **Global Agent Scheduling** - Double-booking prevention and buffer enforcement across all properties

## 🏠 Add Property Feature

Agents and admins can add new property listings directly from the frontend UI. This feature is accessible from:

1. **Agent Dashboard** - "Add Property" button in the header
2. **Admin Dashboard** - "Add Property" button in the header
3. **Properties Page** - "Add Property" button visible when logged in as agent/admin

### Add Property Form Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Property Title | ✅ | Name/title of the property listing |
| Address | ✅ | Street address of the property |
| City | ✅ | City name (defaults to Davao City) |
| Price (₱) | ✅ | Listing price in Philippine Peso |
| Description | ✅ | Property description and details |
| Bedrooms | ✅ | Number of bedrooms (integer) |
| Bathrooms | ✅ | Number of bathrooms (integer) |
| Area (sqm) | ✅ | Property area in square meters |
| Image URL | ✅ | URL to property image (Unsplash, Imgur, etc.) |
| Features | ❌ | Comma-separated list of features (Pool, Garden, etc.) |
| Exclusive | ❌ | Checkbox to mark as exclusive listing |

### How to Add a Property

1. Log in as an **Agent** or **Admin**
2. Navigate to the **Properties** page, **Agent Dashboard**, or **Admin Dashboard**
3. Click the **"Add Property"** button
4. Fill in all required fields in the form modal
5. Optionally add features (comma-separated) and mark as exclusive
6. Click **"Add Property"** to submit
7. The new property appears immediately on the /properties page

### Access Control

- **Customers**: Cannot see or access the Add Property feature
- **Agents**: Can add properties (assigned to them automatically)
- **Admins**: Can add properties

### Technical Notes

- Properties are added via `addProperty()` function in `AppContext.tsx`
- New properties get a UUID generated by the `uuid` library
- Properties default to `status: 'available'`
- Agent-added properties are automatically assigned to that agent via `assignedAgentId`

## 🔧 Core System Rules & Logic

### Enhanced Booking & Sales Completion Flow

This system implements an enhanced booking flow with exclusive/shared property viewings, agent-controlled appointment completion, and property state transitions.

#### Appointment Status Flow

```
┌─────────────┐     Agent      ┌──────────┐
│   PENDING   │ ─── Accept ──▶ │ ACCEPTED │
└─────────────┘                └──────────┘
       │                            │
       │ Agent                      │ Agent Action
       │ Reject                     ▼
       │                    ┌───────────────┐
       ▼                    │  DONE or SOLD │
┌──────────────────┐        └───────────────┘
│ PENDING_APPROVAL │               │
│ (new agent auto- │               │
│  assigned)       │               │
└──────────────────┘               │
       │                           ▼
       │ Customer             ┌─────────┐
       │ Approve              │ Property│
       ▼                      │ State   │
┌─────────────┐               │ Change  │
│   PENDING   │               └─────────┘
└─────────────┘
```

#### Status Behavior Summary Table

| Status | Description | Property Available? | Customer Action | Agent Action |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `pending` | Awaiting agent confirmation | Pending (first viewer) | Wait | Accept/Reject |
| `pending_approval` | New agent assigned, needs customer approval | Pending | Approve agent or Select different | Wait |
| `accepted` | Viewing confirmed | Pending | Attend viewing | Mark Done/Sold |
| `done` | Viewing finished, no purchase | ✅ Available | - | - |
| `sold` | Property purchased | ❌ Sold | - | - |
| `rejected` | Agent declined | Depends | Select new agent | - |
| `cancelled` | Booking cancelled | Depends | - | - |

#### Agent Appointment Completion Actions

When an agent has an accepted appointment, they control when and how the viewing ends:

1. **Mark as Done** (`done` status):
   - Viewing finished, customer did not purchase
   - Property immediately becomes available for new bookings
   - Queued customers are notified that property is available
   - Agent's buffer period (2 hours) applies

2. **Mark as Sold** (`sold` status):
   - Property purchased by customer
   - Property status changes to `sold`
   - Property hidden from customer search/booking
   - All other pending viewings for this property are cancelled
   - Affected customers receive cancellation notification
   - Agent's sales count incremented
   - Property added to Agent's "Sold Properties" tab

#### Property Visibility Rules

| User Role | Available | Pending | Sold |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------|
| Customer/Public | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ❌ Hidden |
| Agent | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible (Sold tab) |
| Admin | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible (Sold tab) |

#### Notification Flow for Status Changes

| Event | Recipient | Notification Type |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Viewing marked done | Customer | `viewing_done` |
| Property becomes available | Queued customers | `property_available` |
| Property sold | Buyer | `property_sold` (congratulations) |
| Property sold | Other customers with pending viewings | `property_sold` (cancelled) |

### 7-Day Rolling Booking Window
```
CONSTANT BOOKING_WINDOW_DAYS = 7

FUNCTION isDateWithinBookingWindow(dateString):
    today = getCurrentDate()
    maxDate = today + BOOKING_WINDOW_DAYS
    
    RETURN date >= today AND date <= maxDate

// Enforced in BookingModal when showing available time slots
// Prevents bookings or purchase holds beyond this window
```

### Booking Flow (Start-Time-Only Selection)
```
1. Customer selects property → Chooses agent (or auto-assign) → Selects START TIME only (no end time)
2. For exclusive properties: If slot is taken, customer is added to waitlist with queue position
3. For non-exclusive properties: Multiple customers can book same start time (group viewing)
4. Booking submitted as PENDING (or QUEUED for waitlisted) → Agent notified
5. Agent ACCEPTS or REJECTS → Customer notified
6. If rejected: System auto-assigns new available agent → Customer approves or selects different
7. Agent conducts viewing → Agent controls when viewing ends → Marks as DONE (available) or SOLD (purchased)

NOTE: End times are NOT selected by customers. The agent determines when the viewing ends.
```

### Exclusive Property & Waitlist Logic
```
EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY RULES:
1. Properties can be marked as "exclusive" (isExclusive = true)
2. For exclusive properties, only ONE customer can hold a confirmed booking per start time
3. If another customer tries to book an already-taken exclusive slot:
   a. They are added to a visible waitlist (status = 'queued')
   b. Their queue position is displayed (e.g., "You are #2 in line")
   c. They receive notification of their waitlist position
4. When the confirmed customer cancels:
   a. Next in queue is automatically promoted
   b. Promoted customer is notified

NON-EXCLUSIVE (GROUP VIEWING) RULES:
1. Multiple customers can book the same time slot
2. Group size indicator shown (e.g., "Group (3)")
3. All bookings are confirmed independently
```

### Agent Unavailability Management
```
UNAVAILABLE PERIOD RULES:
1. Agents can mark any time period as unavailable via calendar
2. Unavailable periods have: date, startTime, endTime, optional reason
3. Examples: "Lunch break", "Personal event", "Training"
4. Unavailable periods are excluded from customer booking selector
5. Multiple unavailable periods can overlap

FUNCTION isStartTimeAvailable(agentId, date, startTime):
    // Check unavailable periods
    FOR EACH period IN agent.unavailablePeriods:
        IF period.date == date AND startTime >= period.startTime AND startTime < period.endTime:
            RETURN false
    
    // Check existing bookings and vacation status
    ... existing availability checks ...
```

### Purchase Priority Queue Logic
```
PRIORITY RULES:
1. Priority is determined by BOOKING TIMESTAMP (createdAt), NOT viewing date/time
2. First customer to book gets purchase rights (position 1)
3. Subsequent customers join the queue in booking order
4. When a customer cancels, next in queue is automatically promoted
5. Promoted customer receives notification of new priority status

// Priority text displayed:
- Position 1: "You currently hold the first right to purchase"
- Position 2: "You are second in line"
- Position 3: "You are third in line"
- Position N: "You are Nth in line"
```

### Cancel Appointment Flow
```
WHEN customer cancels appointment:
    1. Set appointment status to 'cancelled'
    2. Notify assigned agent of cancellation
    3. IF customer had purchase rights:
        a. Find next customer in queue (by booking timestamp)
        b. Grant them purchase rights
        c. Notify them of promotion
    4. IF no other customers in queue:
        a. Reset property status to 'available'
```

### Buffer/Slot/Availability Logic

```pseudocode
FUNCTION isAgentAvailable(agentId, date, startTime, endTime):
    // Check vacation status
    IF agent.isOnVacation THEN RETURN false
    
    // Check if slot exists and is not blocked
    slot = agent.availability.find(date, startTime, endTime)
    IF slot.isBooked AND NOT slot.bookingId THEN RETURN false  // Manually blocked
    
    // Check for appointment conflicts
    FOR EACH appointment IN appointments:
        IF appointment.agentId == agentId 
           AND appointment.date == date
           AND appointment.status NOT IN ['cancelled', 'rejected']
           AND timeOverlaps(startTime, endTime, appointment.startTime, appointment.endTime):
            RETURN false
    
    // Check configurable buffer after completed appointments
    // Buffer period defined by AGENT_BUFFER_HOURS constant (default: 2 hours)
    completedAppts = getCompletedAppointments(agentId, date)
    FOR EACH completed IN completedAppts:
        bufferEnd = completed.endTime + AGENT_BUFFER_HOURS
        IF startTime < bufferEnd THEN RETURN false
    
    RETURN true

FUNCTION timeOverlaps(start1, end1, start2, end2):
    RETURN start1 < end2 AND end1 > start2
```

### Agent Assignment Priority
```pseudocode
FUNCTION findAvailableAgent(customerId, date, startTime, endTime, excludeIds):
    blacklisted = customer.blacklistedAgentIds
    
    availableAgents = agents.filter(agent =>
        NOT agent.isOnVacation
        AND agent.id NOT IN blacklisted
        AND agent.id NOT IN excludeIds
        AND isAgentAvailable(agent.id, date, startTime, endTime)
    )
    
    // Return first available (could be sorted by rating/availability)
    RETURN availableAgents[0] OR null
```

### Sold Property Management
```pseudocode
FUNCTION markPropertySold(propertyId, salePrice, agentId):
    // Update property status
    property.status = 'sold'
    property.salePrice = salePrice
    property.soldDate = now()
    property.soldByAgentId = agentId
    
    // Update agent stats
    agent.salesCount += 1
    agent.soldProperties.push(propertyId)
    
    // Cancel all pending appointments for this property
    FOR EACH appointment WHERE appointment.propertyId = propertyId:
        IF appointment.status NOT IN ['completed', 'cancelled']:
            appointment.status = 'cancelled'
```

---

## ⚠️ DO NOT BREAK - Business Rules

1. **7-Day Booking Window**: NEVER allow bookings beyond 7 days from today (configurable via `BOOKING_WINDOW_DAYS`)
2. **Double-booking Prevention**: NEVER allow two appointments with same agent at overlapping times (global across all properties)
3. **Buffer Period**: Agent unavailable for configurable hours after completing a viewing (configurable via `AGENT_BUFFER_HOURS`, default: 2 hours)
4. **Race Logic**: First viewer ALWAYS gets purchase rights (by earliest booking timestamp, NOT viewing date)
5. **Priority Promotion**: When first-in-line cancels, ALWAYS promote next customer automatically
6. **Priority Display**: Show priority position to ALL customers, not just first
7. **SMS Verification**: BOTH parties must be verified for messaging to work
8. **Priority Warning**: NEVER show "another customer has priority" to the firstViewerCustomerId
9. **Blacklist Respect**: NEVER assign blacklisted agents to a customer
10. **Sold Property Visibility**: NEVER show sold properties in customer/public property listings
11. **Agent-Only Completion**: ONLY agents can mark appointments as done or sold
12. **Cascade Cancellation**: When property is marked sold, ALL other pending appointments for that property must be cancelled automatically
13. **Instant Availability**: When marked done, property MUST become immediately available for new bookings
14. **Property Assignment**: Only assigned agent or admin can edit a property
15. **Session Check**: All protected routes MUST redirect unauthenticated users to login

## 📊 Sample Queue Display Table

Example of the purchase priority queue shown to agents:

| # | Customer | Booked | Viewing Date |
|---|----------|--------|--------------|
| **1st** | Juan Dela Cruz | 2 hours ago | Dec 15, 2024 |
| 2 | Maria Garcia | 1 day ago | Dec 16, 2024 |
| 3 | Jose Santos | 2 days ago | Dec 14, 2024 |

*Note: Juan is first because he booked first (2 hours ago), even though Jose's viewing is earlier (Dec 14).*

## 🔌 How to Extend/Modify

### Modifying Booking Window
```typescript
// In src/context/AppContext.tsx
export const BOOKING_WINDOW_DAYS = 7;  // ← Modify this value
```

### Adding New Appointment Status
1. Add status to `Appointment['status']` union type in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add color mapping in `getStatusBadgeColor()` functions
3. Update status filters in dashboard components
4. Add notification type if needed

### Adding New User Fields
1. Update `User` or `Agent` interface in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add to mock data in `src/data/mockData.ts`
3. Update profile settings page to handle new field
4. Add context function if field needs updating

### Modifying Buffer Period
```typescript
// In src/context/AppContext.tsx
export const AGENT_BUFFER_HOURS = 2;  // ← Modify this value (hours of rest after viewing)
```

### Adding New Notification Types
1. Add type to `Notification['type']` in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Use `addNotification()` from AppContext where needed

### Adding Real SMS Verification
Replace the demo verification in settings pages:
```typescript
// Replace this demo code:
if (smsCode.length === 6) {
  updateUserSmsVerification(currentUser.id, true);
}

// With actual API call:
const response = await verifySmsCode(phone, smsCode);
if (response.success) {
  updateUserSmsVerification(currentUser.id, true);
}
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run lint     # Run linting
```

### Demo Login
- **Customer**: Browse properties and book viewings
- **Agent**: Manage bookings and availability
- **Admin**: Access via `/internal/admin/dashboard`

---

## 📅 Calendar Logic (Agent)

### Full-Month View
- Google Calendar-style monthly grid showing all days
- Each day cell shows appointment previews (up to 3) with status colors
- Click any day to switch to day view
- Navigation: Previous/Next month, Today button

### Day View
- Hourly time slots from 8 AM to 6 PM
- Shows appointments, blocked slots, and buffer periods
- Color coding: Yellow (Pending), Green (Accepted), Blue (Scheduled), Gray (Completed)
- Buffer periods shown in orange (2-hour rest after completed viewings)

### Buffer Enforcement
```
After a COMPLETED appointment ends:
  → Next 2 hours are automatically blocked
  → Buffer slots shown in orange on calendar
  → Agent cannot be booked during buffer period
```

---

## 📱 Profile Flows & Verification

### Settings Page (Customer & Agent)
1. **Profile Information**: Name, Email, Phone (editable)
2. **Phone Verification Section**:
   - Shows current verification status (green = verified, yellow = not verified)
   - Unverified users see "Send Verification Code" button
   - Demo: Any 6-digit code verifies the phone

> **Note**: This demo app uses role-based login without passwords. Password change functionality is not currently implemented. See [Planned Enhancements](#planned-enhancements) for future authentication features.

### What Blocks Users from Acting
| Blocker | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Not logged in | Cannot book, access dashboards |
| Not SMS verified | Cannot message (both parties need verification) |
| Agent on vacation | Hidden from agent selection |
| Blacklisted agent | Never assigned to that customer |

### Phone Verification Storage
- Stored in `User.smsVerified` and `Agent.smsVerified` fields
- Updated via `updateUserSmsVerification()` or `updateAgentSmsVerification()`
- Persisted in React context state (demo only - production needs backend)

---

## 📬 Automated Messaging & Notifications

### One-Way Notifications (System → User)
All notifications are **system-generated** and one-way. Users cannot reply to notifications.

### Notification Types
| Type | Recipient | Trigger |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `booking_new` | Agent | New booking assigned |
| `booking_accepted` | Customer | Agent accepts booking |
| `booking_rejected` | Customer | Agent rejects booking |
| `agent_reassigned` | Customer | New agent auto-assigned after rejection |
| `no_agents_available` | Customer | No agents available for slot |
| `viewing_only` | Customer | Another customer has priority |
| `viewing_done` | Customer | Agent marked viewing as completed |
| `property_available` | Queued customers | Property became available after viewing |
| `property_sold` | Buyer | Congratulations on purchase |
| `property_sold` | Other customers | Pending viewing cancelled due to sale |
| `viewing_queued` | Customer | Viewing queued due to prior bookings |
| `appointment_reminder` | Agent & Customer | Upcoming appointment reminder (24 hours before) |
| `priority_promoted` | Customer | Promoted in purchase queue after cancellation |
| `appointment_cancelled` | Agent | Customer cancelled their appointment |

### Messaging (Two-Way Chat)
- **Requirements**: Both customer AND agent must be SMS verified
- **Scope**: Only available for ACCEPTED or SCHEDULED appointments
- **Location**: Chat drawer accessible from header
- **Templates**: Distinct from notifications - conversational messages only

### Centralized Notification Service
All notifications flow through `addNotification()` in AppContext:
```typescript
addNotification({
  userId: recipientId,
  type: 'notification_type',
  title: 'Title',
  message: 'Message content',
  read: false,
  relatedId: appointmentOrPropertyId,
});
```

### Appointment Reminders
The system includes built-in reminder functionality:
- **Timing**: Reminders sent 24 hours before scheduled appointments
- **Recipients**: Both agent AND customer receive reminders
- **Deduplication**: Only one reminder per appointment per day
- **Usage**: Call `sendAppointmentReminders()` from AppContext (typically in a scheduled job or on app load)

```typescript
// To send reminders (e.g., in a useEffect or scheduled task)
const { sendAppointmentReminders } = useApp();
sendAppointmentReminders();
```

## 🔄 Real-Time Sync Considerations

This demo application uses React Context for state management. For production deployment with real-time features:

### Current Implementation
- All state managed via `AppContext.tsx`
- Changes are immediately reflected across all components
- State is reset on page refresh (no persistence)

### Production Enhancement Recommendations
1. **WebSocket Integration**: Add Socket.io or similar for real-time updates across clients
2. **Backend API**: Replace mock data with actual REST/GraphQL API calls
3. **State Persistence**: Add localStorage/sessionStorage or integrate with a state management library
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
5. **Session Management**: Add token-based authentication with refresh tokens

### Session/Authentication Checks
- All protected pages check `currentUser` state before rendering
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to login page
- Role-based access control enforced at component level
- Demo mode: Role-based login without password (production needs proper auth)

---

## ⚠️ Developer & AI Warnings

### DRY Principle
- **DO NOT** duplicate business logic - all core logic lives in `AppContext.tsx`
- **DO NOT** create duplicate notification functions - use `addNotification()`
- **DO NOT** duplicate status color mappings - reference existing `getStatusBadgeColor()` functions

### Inheritance & Type Safety
- All user types extend base `User` interface
- `Agent` extends `User` with agent-specific fields
- Always use TypeScript interfaces from `src/types/index.ts`

### Mandatory README Updates
> **Every PR must include README updates if it changes:**
> - Any UI component or page
> - Any user flow or state
> - Any business logic
> - Screenshots must be current - remove/replace outdated images
